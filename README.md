## Section 1 – Research and inspiration:

**1-1 Okazz_Japanese generative artist and creative coder**

Okazz's work has a unique style that combines geometric abstraction, soft curves and dynamic visuals to create organic forms through complex generative rules. This style can inspire the following projects:

1. A sense of static growth
Using algorithms such as Perlin Noise to generate natural curves can give an image a sense of flow, giving static images a soft, natural dynamic feel.

2. Layers and Space
Okazz's geometric compositions are layered, adding visual depth through transparency and repetitive structures. We can use geometric shapes of different sizes superimposed on each other, or adjust the transparency and colour of the shapes to create a sense of layering, making the image complex and coordinated, in line with the abstract qualities of ‘Apple Tree’.

3. Precise control of randomisation
Okazz is good at controlling random geometrical generation, so that the graphics are random and orderly at the same time. We can use random parameters in the code to generate a variety of tree structures, and at the same time, we can use specific rules (e.g. symmetry or repetition) to make the images not look cluttered. This retains the richness of generative art, but also conforms to the balanced aesthetics of static images.

4. Harmonious colour gradients
Okazz often uses gradients and rich colours to enhance the depth of the work. We can introduce gradient tones or layered shading into the code to add visual tension to geometric forms, making patterns appear both abstract and harmonious. Colour gradients and subtle tones can help us achieve a subdued effect like The Apple Tree.

5. Balance of randomisation and control
Okazz maintains a delicate balance between controlled graphic variation and randomness, creating an aesthetic of ‘disorder within order’. In our projects, we can introduce noise-controlled randomisation parameters to create balanced but natural tree structures that add visual interest and variety.

These techniques will help our code implementation of The Apple Tree give a natural and harmonious structure while retaining the unique depth of generative art.
